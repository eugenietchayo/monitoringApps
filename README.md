1) Actuator:
   The Actuator is used to monitor our applications. It gives us lots of information regarding projects like, the
   average of memory consumption, etc.
   To use it, head over to: http://localhost:8888/actuator/
   Copy and paste that link to a navigator. On the results, you will see the list of endpoints exposed by the actuator,
   for example:
   http://localhost:8888/actuator/health

If you hit one of the endpoint, for instance http://localhost:8888/actuator/health, you will see information related to
the memory consumption of the application.
